# Sessions
Safari extension to save your working sessions

Have you ever been working on a project, with dozens of tabs open, and wondered how to save that window?
With *Sessions* you can easily save them, to re-open them whenever you'll want to!

## Features:
- Export as json
- Rename sessions
- Search

## Installation
Download and compile. Copy the file Sessions.app into your Application's folder. Open it.

Safari will warn you that this extension can read sensible information from every website. That's because *Sessions* needs a high level read permission to get the URLs of the websites you have open. *Sessions* won't ever read any personal information.

As you enable the extension from the Safari's settings window you should see a new icon appear in the bar.

### Actions
* **Click** on the **save** button to store the current working session <sup>[1](#note1)</sup> 
* **Double click** on a previously saved to re-open it
* **Click** on the **settings icon** next to the name of the session to view some other actions:
	* **Restore** - Same as double-click action
	* **Remove** - Deletes the sessions (Caution! <mark>**This action is irreversible!**</mark>)
	* **Rename** - Same as one-click action. Lets you rename the session (the default name is the title of the first tab open when you clicked on *save*)
	* **Export** - Creates a .json file in the Downloads folder with every information *Sessions* has stored concerning about that session
